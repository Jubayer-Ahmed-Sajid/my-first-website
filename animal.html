        <p class="r_dscrptn">The rhinoceros, commonly referred to as a rhino, is a large herbivorous mammal known for its distinctive appearance and impressive size. Rhinos belong to the family Rhinocerotidae and are characterized by their thick, armor-like skin and one or two horn-like structures on their snouts</p>

       <p class="r_dscrptn">
        Rhinos are known for their powerful build, with some individuals weighing several tons. They have relatively short legs, a stocky body, and a large head. The horns of a rhino are made of keratin, the same material as human hair and nails, and are used for defense, territorial displays, and sometimes for digging or breaking vegetation.
